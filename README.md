## Use PPO to play BipedalWalker


Please visit my blog for more detail: https://junhongxu.github.io/JunhongXu.github.io/Proximal-Policy-Optimization/

To run the code, ```python play_bipedalwalker.py```.

You can actually try out other continuous gym environment like cartpole, just
remember to tune the hyper-parameters a bit.

## TODO:

Use PPO to play TORCS.
